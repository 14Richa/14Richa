Software Engineer with a passion for open source and giving back to the community. Selected for GSoC 2023 with Postman and AsyncAPI, and a former participant of Outreachy 2020 with Mozilla. I've had the pleasure of contributing to projects at Mozilla and Layer 5, and I'm always looking for new ways to get involved in the community. 

When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring new destinations or getting my sweat on at cult.fit. I truly believe that travel and fitness are key ingredients to a happy, healthy life. They keep me energized and inspired, and I always come back to my work with fresh ideas and perspectives. 

Thanks for stopping by my profile! Feel free to check out my open source projects and don't hesitate to get in touch.ðŸ˜„
